# zlock [-sxon] [-w timeout] lockfile [-c] command...
#       -s, --shared          Obtain a shared lock, sometimes called a read lock.
#       -x, -e, --exclusive
#              Obtain an exclusive lock, sometimes called a write lock.  This is the default.
#       -u, --unlock          Drop  a lock
#       -n, --nb, --nonblock
#              Fail (with an exit code of 1) rather than wait if the lock cannot be immediately acquired.
#       -w, --wait, --timeout seconds
#              Fail (with an exit code of 1) if the lock cannot be acquired within seconds seconds.  Decimal fractional values are allowed.
#       -o, --close
#              Close the file descriptor on which the lock is held before executing command.  This is useful if command spawns a child process which should not be holding the lock.
#       -c, --command command

#       -h, --help
